# School project: Java Application

This is a school project I worked on the Programming 2 -course with another student.

The application is a music registry, for the user to save names of songs. It's not really all that related to cybersecurtiy, but showcases some programming understanding. 

The naming conventions were in finnish, and are a bit weird sometimes, like the main folder of the program being called "musiikki". The program utilizes quite a few specific libraries and imports that were used on the course, so it may take some work to get running.

Utilizes interfaces, extending classes, object oriented programming, and is a good showcase of the basics of Java (such as loops and functions). The GUI is designed with an UI-designer called JavaFX.
