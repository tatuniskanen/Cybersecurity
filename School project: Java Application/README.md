# School project: Java Application

This is a school project I worked on the programming 2 -course with another student.

The application is a music registry, for the user to save names of songs. It's not really all that related to cybersecurtiy, but showcases some programming understanding. 

Utilizes thing such as interfaces and extending classes.
