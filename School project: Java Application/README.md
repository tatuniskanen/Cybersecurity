# School project: Java Application

This is a school project I worked on the Programming 2 -course with another student.

The application is a music registry for the user to save names of songs. It's not really all that related to cybersecurtiy, but showcases some programming understanding. 

The naming conventions were in finnish, and are a bit weird sometimes, like the main folder of the program being called "musiikki". The program utilizes quite a few specific libraries and imports that were used on the course, so it may take some work to get running.

The GUI is designed with an UI-designer called JavaFX.

## What it showcases / What I learned
* Interfaces
* Extending classes
* Object oriented programming
* Developing a program with multiple classes
* Good commenting practices
* Good showcase of Java basics (loops, functions, etc.)
* Tests
