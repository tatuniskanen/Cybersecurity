"The lead graphical designer at ACME has noticed some kind of strange activity on her computer. Their IT support believes it is a false positive and the computer will fix itself after turning it off and on again. However, the user managed to take a memory dump just before the crash. **Could you help us recover the documentation she was working on?**"

In the first part of this exercise you are asked to retrieve a text document from a memory dump. 

## Execution

I started by installing and learning to use Volatility. The analysis starts with specifyin the os profile to Volatility using "imageinfo". From there I looked at what processes were running before the crash, and noticed that notepad.exe was one of the active processes. Looking at the recent console entries, i also found mentions of a document called flag.txt. I figured this is the document in question, and since it's a .txt -file, it is probably written with the active notepad.
