"The lead graphical designer at ACME has noticed some kind of strange activity on her computer. Their IT support believes it is a false positive and the computer will fix itself after turning it off and on again. However, the user managed to take a memory dump just before the crash."

This is an exercise in memory dump analysis. It involves trying to extract specific files and details from the memory dump of a crashed computer with recent malicious activity. The tool I chose for this was Volatility. 

The exercise is divided into five parts, each about recovering different things. I will document the parts in seperate folders with pictures of the process.
